# NnSwiftPlayground

(A place share my Swift and SwiftUI experiments)

This organization will gradually grow as I publish demo projects that showcase custom view modifiers I use often in my own development. I’ll also use it to highlight SwiftUI behavior, bugs, or edge cases I’ve run into while building apps. Everything is public and open source, and each project focuses on doing one thing clearly and cleanly.

## What to Expect

You’ll find:

- Individual demo projects, each in its own repository
- Custom SwiftUI view modifiers with working examples
- Isolated reproductions of SwiftUI bugs or unexpected behavior
- A new project published every Thursday

Each repository includes an Xcode 16 project with a README that explains what the demo does and how it’s set up. Everything is licensed under MIT.

## Feedback

This isn’t an open-source project I expect contributions on, but if you have thoughts or ideas, I’d genuinely like to hear them. Whether it’s a better way to use a modifier, an edge case I missed, or just something you found useful, I’m always open to feedback.
